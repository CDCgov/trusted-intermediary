# CDC Trusted Intermediary

## Requirements

Any distribution of the Java 17 JDK.

## Using and Running

To run the application directly, execute...

```shell
./gradlew clean run
```

This will run the web API on port 8080.  You can view the API documentation at _TBD_.

## Development

### Additional Requirements

The additional requirements needed to contribute towards development are...

- [Pre-Commit](https://pre-commit.com).
- [Locust.io](https://docs.locust.io/en/stable/installation.html)
- [Python](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/installation/)

### Compiling

To compile the application, execute...

```shell
./gradlew clean build
```

Once compiled, the built artifact is _TBD_.

### Testing

#### Unit Tests

To run the unit tests, execute...

```shell
./gradlew clean app:test
```

#### End-to-end Tests

End-to-end tests are meant to interact and assert the overall flow of the API is operating correctly.

To run them, execute...

```shell
./gradlew clean e2e:test
```

That requires the API to be running already.  To help streamline the execution of this flow, a helper Bash script can be executed...

```shell
./e2e-execute.sh
```

This will start the API, wait for it to respond, run the end-to-end tests against that running API, and then stop the API.

These tests are located under the `e2e` Gradle sub-project directory.  Like any Gradle project, there are the `main` and `test` directories.
The `test` directory contains the tests.  The `main` directory contains our custom framework that helps us interact with the API.

#### Load Testing

Load tests are completed with [Locust.io](https://docs.locust.io/en/stable/installation.html). To run load tests:

Install Python (3.7 or later), then...

```shell
pip3 install locust
```

You can quickly validate the install with `locust -V`.

A *locustfile.py* is required to run the tests and there is currently one located
in `/operations`

Run the application...

In a terminal, navigate to the directory *locustfile.py* is in and run

```shell
locust
```

The terminal will start a local web interface and you can enter
the swarm parameters for the test and the local url where the app is running
(usually http://localhost:8080).

You can also set time limits for the tests under 'Advanced Settings'.

### Pre-Commit Hooks

We use [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com) to run [some hooks](./.pre-commit-config.yaml) on every commit.  These
hooks do linting to ensure things are in a good spot before a commit is made.  Please install `pre-commit` and then
install the hooks.

```shell
pre-commit install
```
