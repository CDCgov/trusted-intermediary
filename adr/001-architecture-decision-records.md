# 1. Architecture Decision Records

Date: 2022-10-21

## Decision

We will use Architectural Decisions Records (ADRs).  We will use the same format as this ADR.

## Status

Accepted.

## Context

ADRs are originally described by [Michael Nygard in an article](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions) and more robustly detailed and demonstrated [on GitHub](https://adr.github.io).

We want to record our architectural decisions so that...

- New team members who join can see why we made the decisions we made.


- The team can revise or revisit decisions with more confidence and context.

## Impact

The outcomes of the decision, both positive and negative. This section should explain the impact of the decision, such as trade-offs, risks, and what needs to be done to implement it.

### Positive

- **Transparency**: ADRs make decision-making more transparent, helping current and future team members understand the rationale behind decisions.


- **Historical Context**: They provide valuable historical context, aiding in future decision-making and avoiding repeated mistakes.


- **Onboarding**: ADRs speed up the onboarding process by quickly familiarizing new team members with architectural decisions.


- **Consistency**: A standardized format ensures consistent documentation, making records easier to maintain and reference.

### Negative

- **Overhead**: Maintaining ADRs requires time and effort.


- **Outdated Records**: If not regularly updated, ADRs can become outdated and misleading.

### Risks

- **Incomplete Documentation**: Not all decisions may be documented, leading to gaps in the record.


- **Misalignment**: ADRs may not always match the actual implementation, causing confusion.
